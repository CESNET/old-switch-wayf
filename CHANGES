          Reported by Tom Scavo.
          
1.14.3  Release date: 4. March 2011
        - Fixed a race condition. Thanks go to Robert Basch from MIT for 
          reporting the issue and providing a patch.

1.14.2  Release date: 15. December 2010
        - IDProvider.conf.php and config.php are not overwritten anymore by upgrades
        - Logging to syslog now works properly and is more consistent
        - Access log now properly locks file
        - Unknown category is not shown anymore when there is no other category
        - Namespaces are now taken properly into account when parsing SAML2 
          metadata. Thanks go to Olivier Salaün for reporting this issue and
          submitting a patch.
        - Improved installation instructions

1.14.1  Release date: 12. November 2010
        - Fixed an encoding bug that affected non-ASCII characters in 
          JavaScripts. Thanks to Prof. Kazutsuna Yamaji for reporting this issue.
        - Corrected behaviour of $enableDSReturnParamCheck and 
          $useACURLsForReturnParamCheck. There won't be an error anymore if an SP 
          has no <idpdisc:DiscoveryResponse> extension defined. In such a case
          there will only be a check if $useACURLsForReturnParamCheck is enabled.
        - Fixed a bug in readMetadata.php that prevented CLI execution
        - Changed the default configuration option to generate the Embedded WAYF
          to false due to some concerns regarding phishing attacks
        - Added proper copyright statements to all source code files

1.14   Release date: 9. November 2010
        - Added the configuration option wayf_force_remember_for_session to
         the Embedded WAYF on request of Wolgang Lierz. This
         option allows setting the remember for session checkbox to true
       - The 'return' parameter of a Discovery Service request can now be 
         checked using the idp-discovery-protocol extension or using the FQDN 
         of all the Service Provider's assertion consumer URLs. The latter 
         alternative is less secure but still offers better security against 
         phising attacks. Have a look at config.dist.php and the README for 
         more detailed explanations on these feature.
       - Metadata parsing now uses DOM XML for PHP5 instead of Simple XML
       - Fixed a minor HTML error in template for Embedded WAYF
       - Sorting within categories works now correctly if SAML2 metadata is 
         used to generate Identity Provider drop-down list. 
         Thanks to Prof. Kazutsuna Yamaji
         Informatics (NII) for reporting this issue.
       - Fixed a minor bug in templates.php that cause PHP warnings to show up
         in case an invalid IdP was stored in the cookie.
       - Fixed a bug affecting the Kerberos authentication.
         Thanks to Robert Basch for reporting these bugs and for 
         submitting patches.
       - Fixed a bug where hidden IdPs would still be shown in Embedded WAYF
